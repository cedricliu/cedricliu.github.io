<h2>NSX Marketing Campaign</h2>

[2016 Acura NSX Tech Secrets Revealed](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1097978_2016-acura-nsx-tech-secrets-revealed)

For the Acura NSX, I worked with a single dataset to create:

- Photorealistic imagery showcasing the car’s design.
- Dynamic marketing videos that highlighted its performance.
- An interactive Unity AR experience for immersive customer engagement.

This project exemplifies how my role bridges the gap between heavy production data and innovative, lightweight 3D experiences. I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of real-time artistry to deliver assets that are both efficient and visually stunning.

<h2>What I Do</h2>

- Optimization for Efficiency: I streamline complex 3D data into lightweight formats without sacrificing quality.
- 3D Asset Creation: I craft assets from concept to final delivery, tailored for diverse outputs such as marketing visuals and interactive AR.
- Digiatl Asset Management: I utilize DeltaGen for asset management and version control, ensuring a seamless pipeline for production teams.

As a real-time artist working in the Virtual Garage, I specialize in transforming heavy production data into lightweight, optimized 3D assets. Using Dassault Systèmes' 3DExcite DeltaGen, I ensure that each model is fine-tuned for polycount, draw calls, and shader complexity, making it ready for photorealistic renders, animations, and interactive AR applications.
