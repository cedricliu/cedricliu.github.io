Introduction

As a Technical Artist, I've had the privilege of contributing to Mercedes-Benz's groundbreaking AR Drive concept. This project pushed the boundaries of automotive design, blending the physical and digital worlds to create an immersive and innovative driving experience.

Early Phase Asset Exploration

The initial phase of the project involved extensive exploration of digital assets. We experimented with various 3D modeling techniques, materials, and lighting setups to achieve a visually stunning and realistic representation of the AR elements. A key challenge was to balance the complexity of the assets with the performance requirements of the AR system.

Demoing to Top Management

To effectively communicate the potential of the AR Drive concept to top management, we created a series of interactive demos. These demos showcased the seamless integration of AR elements into the real-world driving environment, highlighting the benefits of improved navigation, safety, and overall driving experience.

Cross-Functional Collaboration

Successful execution of the AR Drive concept required close collaboration with a diverse team of designers, engineers, and programmers. As a Technical Artist, I played a crucial role in bridging the gap between artistic vision and technical feasibility. I worked closely with designers to refine the visual style of the AR elements, and with engineers to optimize the performance of the AR system.

Key Challenges and Solutions

Asset Optimization: To ensure smooth performance, we employed various optimization techniques, such as reducing polygon counts, optimizing textures, and using level-of-detail (LOD) models.
PLA Animation Baked In: We integrated pre-baked animation data into the 3D models to minimize runtime calculations and improve performance.
Particle Exploration: Creating visually appealing and performant particle effects for the AR environment required careful experimentation with different particle systems and shaders.

The AR Drive concept represents a significant step forward in automotive technology. By combining cutting-edge AR technology with innovative design, we have created a truly immersive and personalized driving experience. As a Technical Artist, I am proud to have contributed to this groundbreaking project and look forward to the future of automotive design.
