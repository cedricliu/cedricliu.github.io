As a Technical Artist, I excel at merging creativity with technology in 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and augmented reality (AR) development. Proficient in tools like Blender, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Python scripting, I focus on optimizing workflows and delivering high-performance visual assets.

My strength lies in creating interactive experiences that engage users and inspire innovation. Whether optimizing 3D models, developing custom production tools, or collaborating with diverse teams, I bring both artistic vision and technical expertise to every project.

Aside from working on the emerging technologies, I’m passionate about bridging the gap between art and technology to craft immersive solutions that enhance user experiences. If you’re seeking a Technical Artist to tackle design challenges in industrial applications, let’s connect and create something extraordinary!
